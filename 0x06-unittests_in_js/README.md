sinon.spy() is a feature that allows you to create a spy function, which records information about function calls made during a test. Spies can be useful for verifying that certain functions are called with specific arguments or for gathering information about function invocations.

sinon.stub() method to create stub functions, which are similar to spies but with predefined behavior. Stubs allow you to replace a function with a custom implementation, controlling its return values and behavior during testing.

Hooks are useful functions that can be called before or after executing one or all tests in a suite. Example: beforeEach and afterEach
